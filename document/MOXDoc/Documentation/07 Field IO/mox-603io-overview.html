	<h2>MOX Modular 603 I/O</h2>
	
	<blockquote>MOX 603 Modular I/O is one of the most industry capable field I/O solutions available. A true redundant solution utilising standard Open Systems communications</blockquote>
	
	<h3>Features</h3>
	
	
	
	<ul>
		<li>Intelligent microprocessor based platform</li>
		<li>Open systems architecture</li> 
		<li>True redundancy built in at every level</li>
		<li>Immediate integration with MOX controllers</li>
		<li>Wide operating temperature range</li>
		<li>User configurable, module specific options</li>
		<li>Short circuit and open wire detection on some modules</li>
		<li>Automatic fault detection</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The MOX 603 Modular I/O System offers one of the most industry capable I/O Systems available today. Designed around current needs and future desires, it will meet almost every users particular needs. The wide range of I/O modules includes discrete, analog, and special purpose modules. Each one offers comprehensive configuration options.</p>
	<p>Being microprocessor based allows them to manage their own communications parameters, error conditions and user options. This inbuilt intelligence allows the modules to be installed in multi-module rack based configurations.</p>
	<p>The MOX 603 Modular I/O System is designed to meet the most demanding I/O and process control needs. Product safety and high reliability is paramount. The solid construction also ensures that all modules are ready to withstand the rigors of any industrial installation.</p>

	<p>The MOX 603 Modular I/O System is designed in two parts, a System Base and an I/O Module. The system base offers a level of isolation by allowing pre-wiring of the field devices. The removable terminal strips in the base also extend this isolation. The I/O Module may then be plugged directly into the Base. I/O Modules are hot swappable and may be inserted or removed without the need to isolate module power or field devices. Physical guides and module safety keying allow the module to slide into the correct position quickly, safely and without risk of damage.</p>
	<p>The Open Systems architecture of the MOX 603 I/O System means that the Communications Processor will utilise one of the many standard protocols to communicate with the Host Controller, including Serial, Ethernet, Profibus and many others as well as the MOX proprietary high speed protocol, MoxNET. Each MOX 603 I/O Module provides comprehensive information to the user so that the operational status may be monitored and controlled more efficiently. The wide range of module specific diagnostics information may be accessed from the master controller.</p>
