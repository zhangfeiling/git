	<h2>MOXGRAF</h2>
	
	<p>MOXGRAF is a flexible development environment for designing powerful industrial applications simply and without knowledge of complex, high-level computer languages. The MOXGRAF development system is suitable for the Open Controller, Unity as well as IoNix controllers.  The user friendly structured programming methodology and intuitive graphical and textual editors for six automation languages, results in robust applications developed with simplicity and in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>

		<li>Delivers open automation solutions</li>
		<li>IEC 61131-3 compatible applications development</li> 
		<li>Comprehensive on-line help system</li>
		<li>Six IEC Languages plus Flow Chart</li>
		<li>Decreased development time</li>
		<li>Powerful and robust development toolset</li>
		<li>User definable function blocks and libraries</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>With MOXGRAF, application debugging does not require the developer to return to the basic process control logic nor to remember the exact syntax of all languages. At all stages of the development, checks are performed on the program and language specific syntax. Errors are detected and corrected or the user is prompted with the correct use of each language. The extensive hypertext based on-line help system includes a thorough cross-reference explanation of the IEC 61131-3 standard.</p>
	<p>MOXGRAF also features a powerful self-documenting capability. The document generator builds a complete, coherently grouped printed document of all project items and provides a history of their modification. Both graphical and textual programs may be included in the final  documentation, as can the overall project architecture, I/O wiring lists, dictionaries, cross-references and more.</p>
